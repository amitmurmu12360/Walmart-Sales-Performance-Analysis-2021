# Walmart-Sales-Performance-Analysis-2021
## Overview

Welcome to the Walmart Sales Performance Analysis project! This repository contains all the resources, code, and insights from my comprehensive analysis of historical sales data from Walmart. The project aims to shed light on branch performance, product lines, sales trends, and customer behavior. Through meticulous data preparation, in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the creation of interactive visualizations using Power BI, I have extracted valuable insights that can inform business strategies and decision-making.

## Project Objectives

1. **Branch Performance Assessment:** Understand the sales performance of different Walmart branches across different regions.

2. **Product Line Analysis:** Identify top-performing product lines and pinpoint areas that require improvement.

3. **Sales Trend Evaluation:** Analyze sales trends over time to assess the effectiveness of sales strategies and promotions.

4. **Customer Behavior Insights:** Uncover distinct customer segments, their purchasing behavior, and profitability for the business.

5. **KPI Tracking:** Monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to gauge the project's success and provide actionable recommendations for sales optimization.

## Project Components

The project comprises the following components:

1. **SQL Scripts:** Within the "SQL_Scripts" folder, you'll find SQL scripts used for data extraction, cleaning, and feature engineering. These scripts form the foundation of the data preparation process.

2. **Power BI Visualizations:** The "PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix" file contains interactive dashboards and visualizations created using Power BI. These visuals provide an intuitive way to explore the analysis results.

3. **Data:** The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition. It consists of 17 columns and 1000 rows, offering a rich source of sales transaction data.

## How to Use

To explore and engage with this project:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
